Fix the bug in Debian Avahi-daemon

The slow WiFi in Ubuntu problem could be related to a bug in Avahi-daemon of Debian. 
Ubuntu and many other Linux distribution are based on Debian, 
so this bug propagates to several Linux distributions. 

To fix this bug, you have to edit the nsswitch configuration file. 
Open a terminal and use the following command:

$ sudo gedit /etc/nsswitch.conf

This will open the configuration file in gedit so that you could edit it easily in GUI. 
In here, look for the following line:

hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4

If you find this line, replace it with the following line:

hosts: files dns

Save it, close it, restart your computer. 
It should fix the slow wireless connection problem for you.
